# lang

## This is an experiment for writing a compiler from scratch in .Net

### Language Features

* Strongly typed
* Native code with no runtime/GC
* Combines the strengths of C# with the performance of C and ASM
* Full C/C++ interoperability
* Concise standard library
* Modules and packages
* Build tools and project files, not makefiles

### Syntax

```
int main(int argc, List<string> args)
{
    return 0;
}
```

### Support

This is a personal project, so no guarantees. Supporting Linux only for now, Windows eventually since it's not my main OS.
